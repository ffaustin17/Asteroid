Program Description: 
In this program, the user can move a spaceship inside the window and evade the incoming asteroids heading towards
them. An asteroid can either have a normal or large size, and should vary in speed to increase difficulty. The user can also
have the spaceship shoot lasers to destroy the asteroids. The game is over when the spaceship crashes onto an asteroid.
